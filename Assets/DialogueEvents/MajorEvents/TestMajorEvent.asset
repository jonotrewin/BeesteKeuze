  headline: R.F.K. Jr. Says Doctors Found a Dead Worm in His Brain
  newspaperBody: "In 2010, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was experiencing memory loss and
    mental fogginess so severe that a friend grew concerned he might have a brain
    tumor. Mr. Kennedy said he consulted several of the country\u2019s top neurologists,
    many of whom had either treated or spoken to his uncle, Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
    before his death the previous year of brain cancer.\r\n\r\nSeveral doctors noticed
    a dark spot on the younger Mr. Kennedy\u2019s brain scans and concluded that
    he had a tumor, he said in a 2012 deposition reviewed by The New York Times.
    Mr. Kennedy was immediately scheduled for a procedure at Duke University Medical
    Center by the same surgeon who had operated on his uncle, he said.\r\n\r\nWhile
    packing for the trip, he said, he received a call from a doctor at NewYork-Presbyterian
    Hospital who had a different opinion: Mr. Kennedy, he believed, had a dead parasite
    in his head.\r\n\r\n"

      caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died,\u201D
      Mr. Kennedy said in the deposition.  Now an independent presidential candidate,
      the 70-year-old Mr. Kennedy has portrayed his athleticism and relative youth
      as an advantage over the two oldest people to ever seek the White House: President
      Biden, 81, and former President Donald J. Trump, 77. Mr. Kennedy has secured
      a place on the ballots in Utah, Michigan, Hawaii and, his campaign says, California
      and Delaware. His intensive efforts to gain access in more states could put
      him in a position to tip the election."

      health issues, some previously undisclosed, including the apparent parasite. 
      For decades, Mr. Kennedy suffered from atrial fibrillation, a common heartbeat
      abnormality that increases the risk of stroke or heart failure. He has been
      hospitalized at least four times for episodes, although in an interview with
      The Times this winter, he said he had not had an incident in more than a decade
      and believed the condition had disappeared."
